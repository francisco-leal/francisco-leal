### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Francisco and I'm a Full-stack developer with 5+ years of experience and a background on electrical and computer engineering that specialises in modern javascript and ruby.
### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Talent Protocol

Do you know someone that if you could you'd invest in their future? Most of us do and we at Talent Protocol want to create a platform where you can do just that. In sum, <a href="https://talentprotocol.com" target="_blank">Talent Protocol</a> is a decentralized network where talent can launch a branded personal token, and where sponsors can make angel investments in careers they believe in. Imagine a Kickstarter for careers, powered by blockchain.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about

Ruby, Rails, React, Web3. Those are my major focus right now and most of my experience are focused around these. I really enjoy learning and help others learn and one of my current goals is to write more about my experience and my knowledge and to start investing in public speaking.
