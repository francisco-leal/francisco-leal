### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Francisco and I'm a Full-stack developer turned CTO with 7+ years of experience and a background on electrical and computer engineering that specialises in modern javascript and ruby.
### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Talent Protocol, building $BUILD, builder.fi, Talent Passport, etc..

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about

Ruby, Rails, React, Web3. Those are my major focus right now and most of my experience are focused around these. I really enjoy learning and help others learn and one of my current goals is to write more about my experience and my knowledge and to start investing in public speaking.
